# HoloVitals Route Manifest Error - Complete Fix Guide

## 🔴 The Real Problem

Your HoloVitals application is **NOT having a Cloudflare tunnel issue**. The actual problem is:

```
[TypeError: routeManifest.dataRoutes is not iterable]
Main process exited, code=exited, status=1/FAILURE
```

### What This Means

- ✅ **Cloudflare tunnel is working** - It's connecting successfully
- ✅ **Services are starting** - systemd is launching the app
- ❌ **Application is crashing** - Next.js can't start due to corrupted build
- ❌ **Restart loop** - Service keeps trying to restart (counter at 174+)

## 📊 Evidence from Your Logs

### Screenshot 1: Diagnostic Results
- Database tables exist ✓
- Disk space OK (7.4G used of 98G) ✓
- Memory OK (507M used of 1.3G) ✓
- **Issue found:** Application needs attention

### Screenshot 2: Service Crash Loop
```
npm[5933]: ▲ Next.js 15.5.4
npm[5933]: - Local: http://localhost:3000
npm[5933]: - Network: http://192.168.50.162:3000
npm[5933]: [TypeError: routeManifest.dataRoutes is not iterable]
systemd[1]: holovitals.service: Main process exited, code=exited, status=1/FAILURE
systemd[1]: holovitals.service: Failed with result 'exit-code'
systemd[1]: holovitals.service: Scheduled restart job, restart counter is at 175
```

This shows:
1. Next.js tries to start
2. Crashes immediately with route manifest error
3. systemd restarts it
4. Cycle repeats (175+ times!)

### Screenshot 3: Continued Failures
The pattern continues - service keeps crashing and restarting.

## 🎯 Root Cause

This error occurs when:

1. **Corrupted Build Cache** - The `.next` directory has invalid data
2. **Dependency Mismatch** - npm packages are out of sync
3. **Incomplete Build** - Previous build didn't complete properly
4. **Version Conflicts** - Next.js version incompatibilities

## 🔧 The Fix

I've created a script that will:

1. ✅ Stop the crashing service
2. ✅ Backup your current build
3. ✅ Clear corrupted cache
4. ✅ Reinstall all dependencies
5. ✅ Rebuild the application from scratch
6. ✅ Verify the build is valid
7. ✅ Restart the service
8. ✅ Test that it's working

## 🚀 How to Fix It

### Step 1: Download the Fix Script

```bash
cd ~
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cloudbyday90/HoloVitals-Install/main/fix-holovitals-route-manifest.sh
chmod +x fix-holovitals-route-manifest.sh
```

### Step 2: Run the Fix Script

```bash
sudo ./fix-holovitals-route-manifest.sh
```

### Step 3: What to Expect

The script will:
- Take 5-10 minutes to complete
- Show color-coded progress (green = success, red = error)
- Display each step clearly
- Test the application at the end

### Step 4: Verify It's Fixed

After the script completes, check:

```bash
# Check service status
sudo systemctl status holovitals

# Check if it's responding
curl http://localhost:3000

# View recent logs (should show no errors)
journalctl -u holovitals.service -n 20
```

## ✅ Expected Success Output

When fixed, you should see:

```
✓ Service stopped
✓ Backed up .next to .next.backup_20251017_182500
✓ Cleared build cache
✓ Dependencies reinstalled successfully
✓ Build completed successfully
✓ .next directory created
✓ Build ID: abc123xyz
✓ Server build exists
✓ Static assets exist
✓ HoloVitals service started successfully
✓ Application is responding correctly!
✓ Fix completed successfully!
```

## 🔍 If the Fix Doesn't Work

### Check Build Errors

If the build fails, look for:

```bash
# View full build output
journalctl -u holovitals.service -n 100
```

Common issues:
1. **Missing environment variables** - Check `.env.local`
2. **Database connection failed** - Verify PostgreSQL is running
3. **TypeScript errors** - Code issues in the application
4. **Port already in use** - Another process on port 3000

### Verify Environment Variables

```bash
cd /opt/HoloVitals
cat .env.local
```

Required variables:
- `DATABASE_URL` - PostgreSQL connection string
- `NEXTAUTH_URL` - Should be `http://localhost:3000`
- `NEXTAUTH_SECRET` - Random secret key

### Check Database Connection

```bash
sudo systemctl status postgresql
sudo -u postgres psql -d holovitals -c "SELECT 1;"
```

### Check Port Availability

```bash
# See what's using port 3000
sudo netstat -tulpn | grep :3000
# or
sudo ss -tulpn | grep :3000
```

## 🌐 After Fixing the Application

Once the application is running correctly:

### Update Cloudflare Tunnel Config

Your tunnel config shows it's pointing to port 3000, which is correct:

```yaml
ingress:
  - hostname: alpha.holovitals.net
    service: http://localhost:3000
```

But if you see the app is actually on port 3001, update it:

```bash
sudo sed -i 's/localhost:3000/localhost:3001/g' /etc/cloudflared/config.yml
sudo systemctl restart cloudflared
```

### Test the Full Stack

```bash
# 1. Check application
curl http://localhost:3000

# 2. Check tunnel status
sudo systemctl status cloudflared

# 3. Test your domain
curl https://alpha.holovitals.net
```

## 📝 Summary

**The Issue:** Next.js application crashing with route manifest error
**The Cause:** Corrupted build cache and/or dependency issues
**The Fix:** Complete rebuild with the fix script
**The Result:** Application starts cleanly and serves requests

## 🆘 Still Need Help?

If the fix script doesn't resolve the issue:

1. **Save the output:**
   ```bash
   sudo ./fix-holovitals-route-manifest.sh > fix-output.txt 2>&1
   ```

2. **Gather logs:**
   ```bash
   journalctl -u holovitals.service -n 200 > holovitals-logs.txt
   ```

3. **Share both files** along with:
   - Any error messages from the fix script
   - Output of `curl http://localhost:3000`
   - Output of `sudo systemctl status holovitals`

## 🎯 Key Takeaway

**This is NOT a Cloudflare tunnel problem.** The tunnel is working fine. The issue is that your Next.js application can't start due to a corrupted build. Once you rebuild the application, everything will work.
